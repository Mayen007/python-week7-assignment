## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or VS Code with Jupyter extension

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mayen007/python-week7-assignment.git
   cd python-week7-assignment
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Analysis

**Option 1: Jupyter Notebook**

```bash
jupyter notebook
# Open data_analysis_assignment.ipynb and run all cells
```

**Option 2: VS Code**

1. Open `data_analysis_assignment.ipynb` in VS Code
2. Select Python kernel
3. Click "Run All" or run cells individually

## 📈 Analysis Components

### Task 1: Data Loading & Exploration

- Load Iris dataset using sklearn
- Display dataset structure and basic information
- Check for missing values and data quality
- Data cleaning procedures

### Task 2: Statistical Analysis

- Descriptive statistics using `.describe()`
- Groupby analysis for species comparison
- Correlation analysis between features
- Species distribution analysis

### Task 3: Data Visualization

1. **Line Chart**: Measurement trends across samples
2. **Bar Chart**: Average measurements by species comparison
3. **Histogram**: Distribution of measurements by species
4. **Scatter Plot**: Relationships between different measurements

## 🔍 Key Findings

- **Dataset**: 150 samples, 4 features, 3 balanced species
- **Quality**: No missing values, clean dataset
- **Insights**: Strong correlation (0.96) between petal length/width
- **Patterns**: Clear species separation based on petal measurements
- **Characteristics**: Setosa has smallest petals, Virginica has largest

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**: Programming language
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **Seaborn**: Enhanced statistical visualizations
- **Scikit-learn**: Iris dataset access
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **Jupyter**: Interactive development environment

## 📝 Assignment Requirements Met

✅ Dataset loading and exploration  
✅ Basic statistical analysis  
✅ Four different visualization types  
✅ Error handling implementation  
✅ Plot customization with titles, labels, legends  
✅ Findings documentation and observations  
✅ Clean, well-documented code
